				<div class="text2"><p>I've always wondered about the way music makes me feel. How can such beautiful sounds of instruments make someone feel so content yet so desolate and indignant all at the same time? I've become more open minded throughout the years and learned to love all types of music aside from rock. I can listen to almost anything.

								Music was there for me when I thought nobody was there. When I felt alone, it comforted me with its beautiful sounds and mixed feelings that overflowed in me. My head was finally cleared and I was in my own little world when my headphones were on; I was unbothered. Nobody could judge me or my opinions and the way I perceive things. It was just me and the music.

								Halfway through my sophomore year in high school, I was more open to a diverse amount of genres. As high school was coming to an end, I became interested in the music department, so I started teaching myself how to play the guitar. I got busy with school so I decided to put it off. Then I wanted to learn how to play the piano. I learned the beginning of a song but never again did I touch the keyboard.

								I've been surrounded by people who are into music, which may also be a reason as to why music has a place in my heart. Being surrounded by music is amazing and seeing so many talented people play for God has mesmerized me to the point where I want to be able to play for Him. If I can't play an instrument for Him, I will sing to Him.

								I am involved in choir at my church and it has always been my dream to be able to worship and sing to the King of Kings. I may not have a great voice, but I sing with an open and vulnerable heart. As I sing, I could not care less who likes my singing or not. I try my hardest and pour my heart out. The only one I want is Jesus. I want to be able to hear praising Him for everything He's done for me and everyone else.
		
								Music will always be something that will stay in my heart and I will always continue to grow passion for it. It has helped me get through my difficult times when I had been lost and now that I've been found by Jesus, I can use the passion I have for music to worship Him.</p>
